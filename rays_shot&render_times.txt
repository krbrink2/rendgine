Rays shot & render times

photo0.png shot 406,320,494 rays total, and took about seven hours to render. The area light used 128 samples.

photo1.png used 95,249,134 rays, and took about 45 minutes. It only used 20 samples for the area light, explaining the much smaller render time.

These times are approximate; I had to leave the machine running, so I wasn't there to record the exact time the program finished.
