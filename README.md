Rendgine ray tracer

To build, run the Makefile. The executable uses no external libraries other than std, but the animation.sh script uses ffmpeg.

Scene parameters are found as macros in controls.h. The binary rendres the scene into image.png. 

To render an animation, change ANIMATE to "true" in controls.h. The binary will produce a series of frames: a000.png, a001.png. animates.sh produces an mp4 file from these.

FOR CS 419, MP3:
I am making an attempt at the extra credit points with animation capabilities. See the google doc for details.
